The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\\\"\\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\\nWhich of the following provides the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"A\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 41,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"I only\",\n          \"Nationalist movements advocating pan-Americanism\",\n          \"Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was done without congressional oversight.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"B\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 41,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"II only\",\n          \"Revolts organized by provincial elites in Latin American nations\",\n          \"The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"C\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 41,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"III only\",\n          \"Aboriginal natives gathering the support of provincials to create constitutions\",\n          \"Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan provided no assurance of black suffrage.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"D\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 42,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"somatotype theory\",\n          \"Colonial powers preparing their colonies for independence\",\n          \"Lincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president clashed with the Reconstruction goals of the Senate.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"A\",\n          \"B\",\n          \"D\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"task\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"high_school_computer_science\",\n          \"high_school_us_history\",\n          \"high_school_geography\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"predicted_answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"D\",\n          \"B\",\n          \"C\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"correct\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
